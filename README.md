Data Science applied the beloved Battlefield Franchise. The goal of this repository is to house a toolkit for analyzing and gathering data regarding Battlefield matches, servers, players and more.

# Getting Started
For convenience and data gathering a mongodb backend is required. This backend needs to be setup on your machine and then passed into a .env file or directly into class/function calls. Once MongoDB is installed and ready the repository will automatically create the necessary tables as you use the tool.
